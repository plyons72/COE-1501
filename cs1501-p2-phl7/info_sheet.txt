Name:  Patrick Lyons

Lecture section:  1240 (MW 3:00 - 4:15)

Recitation day and time:  Friday at 2:00PM

Assignment #:  Project 2

Program due date:  February 26, 2017 @ Midnight

Handed in date:  February 26, 2017

Source code file name(s):
MyLZW.java







Other file name(s) (if relevant):
info_sheet.txt
results.txt
Files stored in edu/*






Does your program run without error?:
The program compiles correctly and runs, however, the different
modes do not seem to make much difference in compressed size

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:







Additional comments to the grader:
Though the ratios do not change, the time it takes to compress seems
to take much shorter for r and m than for n modes.

For whatever reason, I could not get LZW to compile. I kept getting
"symbol not found" errors at compile time for the java files that were
included in the package as a result, I downloaded the original MyLZW.java
file (unaltered), and used that for my results.txt values.
